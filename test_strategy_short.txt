  OBJECTIVE: The objective of testing is to ensure that the product is functioning as expected, meets the business requirements, is secure, and provides an optimal user experience to customers.
  
  QA DELIVERABLES: - test plans for each feature; - reported bugs, - usability suggestions; -release process document; - test reports

  SCOPE OF TESTING:
- Testing Approach: The testing approach will be a combination of manual and automated testing to cover the various aspects of the site.
- Testing Types: The following testing types will be included:
* Functional Testing: To test the site's functionality, such as product search, add-to-cart, checkout, payment, and order processing.
* Performance Testing: To test the site's performance under different loads, such as peak traffic times and number of concurrent users.
* Security Testing: To test the site's security, such as authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure connections.
* Usability Testing: To test the site's usability, such as ease of navigation, layout, and accessibility.
* Compatibility Testing: To test the site's compatibility with different devices, browsers, and operating systems.

  TEST MANAGEMENT (what resources needed to carry out testing in terms of tooling, environments, supported platforms and versions and test data )
- Test Environment: The test environment will consist of various hardware and software configurations, including the operating system, web server, database server, and client devices.
- Test Data: Test data will be generated and/or sourced from real-world scenarios to simulate different use cases, including product data, customer data, and payment data.
- Test Tools: (list of tools)

- Test Reporting: Test reports will be generated after each round of testing, including test case results, bug reports, and a summary report.
- Testing Schedule: The testing schedule will be determined based on the project timeline and milestones, with testing activities integrated into each phase of development.
- Risk Management: Risk management strategies will be in place to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with the site, such as security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and usability problems.
- Test Sign-Off: The site will be signed-off for release after all test cases have been executed successfully, and all identified issues have been resolved and verified.
